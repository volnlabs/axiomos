# axiom-ebpf - Copilot Coding Agent Instructions

## Project Overview

**axiom-ebpf** is a hobby x86-64 operating system kernel written in Rust. This is a bare-metal OS project that boots using the Limine bootloader and runs on QEMU. The project consists of ~124 Rust source files organized into a kernel and userspace components.

**Project Type:** Operating System Kernel (Bare Metal)
**Primary Language:** Rust (Nightly)
**Target Architecture:** x86_64-unknown-none
**Bootloader:** Limine v9.x
**Build System:** Cargo with custom build.rs scripts
**Repository Size:** Medium (~124 .rs files, 18 .toml files)

## Critical Build Requirements

**System Dependencies:** Install `xorriso` before attempting full builds: `sudo apt install -y xorriso`

**Rust Toolchain:** Nightly channel with components: rustfmt, clippy, llvm-tools-preview, rust-src, miri. Target: x86_64-unknown-none. All configured in `rust-toolchain.toml` and auto-installed.

## Build Process

**WARNING:** Full builds may fail with SSL certificate errors when downloading OVMF firmware. This is why we use `--lib` for validation.

### Build Commands

**DO NOT use `cargo build` or `cargo build --release` on the root crate** - it will fail with the SSL certificate issue mentioned above.

**To build only library crates (kernel subsystems) - RECOMMENDED for validation:**
```bash
cargo build --workspace --lib
```

**To build in release mode:**
```bash
cargo build --workspace --lib --release
```

**Note:** The `kernel`, `init`, and `axiomos` binaries are bare-metal targets that require special build process via the root build.rs. Building these directly will fail. Use `--lib` to build only the library crates which can be built normally.

**Build time:** Expect 1-3 minutes for a clean library build, 2-5 minutes if binaries are included.

The main `axiomos` binary is a runner that builds the kernel, creates a bootable ISO, and launches QEMU. It's primarily used for running the OS, not for code validation.

### Build Artifacts

Key artifacts in `target/`: Limine bootloader, OVMF firmware, `axiomos.iso` (bootable), `disk.img` (ext2 filesystem), kernel binary.

## Testing

### Running Tests

**The kernel crate cannot run standard tests** because it uses a custom linker script for bare-metal targets. Tests will fail with TLS linker errors if you try to run them on the kernel library.

**To run tests on individual workspace crates (RECOMMENDED):**
```bash
cargo test -p kernel_abi
cargo test -p kernel_vfs
cargo test -p kernel_physical_memory
# etc.
```

**DO NOT use `cargo test --workspace --lib`** - it will attempt to test the kernel library with the custom linker and fail.

**To run tests on all kernel subsystem crates:**
```bash
for crate in kernel_abi kernel_devfs kernel_device kernel_elfloader kernel_memapi kernel_pci kernel_physical_memory kernel_syscall kernel_vfs kernel_virtual_memory; do
    cargo test -p $crate
done
```

Note: Most kernel crates have no tests (0 tests run is normal). The kernel itself cannot have unit tests due to its bare-metal nature.

### Miri Tests

The CI runs Miri tests on kernel crates to check for undefined behavior:

```bash
cargo miri setup
cargo miri test -p kernel_abi
cargo miri test -p kernel_vfs
# etc.
```

Miri tests are run separately for each kernel crate. See `.github/workflows/build.yml` for the complete list.

**Miri test time:** ~30 seconds per crate

## Linting and Formatting

### Code Formatting

The project uses rustfmt with custom configuration in `rustfmt.toml`:
```toml
imports_granularity = "Module"
group_imports = "StdExternalCrate"
```

**To check formatting:**
```bash
cargo fmt -- --check
```

**To apply formatting:**
```bash
cargo fmt
```

**Formatting time:** ~1-5 seconds

### Clippy Linting

**ALWAYS run clippy on workspace libraries:**
```bash
cargo clippy --workspace --lib -- -D clippy::all
```

You can also exclude the main binary explicitly:
```bash
cargo clippy --workspace --exclude axiomos -- -D clippy::all
```

**DO NOT run `cargo clippy` without filters** - it will try to build bare-metal binaries and fail.

The CI enforces all clippy warnings as errors (`-D clippy::all`), so you must fix all clippy warnings.

**Clippy time:** ~10-30 seconds for incremental checks, ~2-5 minutes for clean builds

### Known Warnings

The kernel has intentional dead code warnings for unused fields (`physical_frames`, `node` in memory region structs). These are expected.

### Key Files

- **build.rs (root)** - Clones Limine, downloads OVMF (SSL errors occur here), creates ISO with xorriso, creates disk with mke2fs
- **kernel/linker-x86_64.ld** - Custom linker script (causes test failures)
- **Cargo.toml** - Workspace with axiomos runner, kernel, 10 kernel crates, 2 userspace crates

## CI/CD Pipeline

The GitHub Actions workflow runs on push and twice daily with 4 jobs:
1. **Lint:** fmt check, clippy with `-D clippy::all` (CI runs clippy without `--lib` - may have different SSL handling)
2. **Test:** Matrix for debug/release - `cargo test`
3. **Miri:** Matrix for each kernel crate - `cargo miri test -p <crate>`
4. **Build:** `cargo build --release`, uploads axiomos.iso

### Validating Changes Before PR

To replicate CI locally, run these commands in order:

```bash
# 1. Format check (always do this first - it's fast)
cargo fmt -- --check

# 2. Clippy (check libraries only)
cargo clippy --workspace --lib -- -D clippy::all

# 3. Build (check libraries only)
cargo build --workspace --lib

# 4. Test individual crates as needed (kernel crate cannot be tested)
cargo test -p kernel_abi
cargo test -p kernel_vfs
# ... test other modified crates

# 5. Miri tests (optional, only if changing kernel crates)
cargo miri setup
cargo miri test -p kernel_abi
cargo miri test -p kernel_physical_memory
# ... other kernel crates

# 6. Full build validation (optional, requires xorriso and working SSL)
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y xorriso
cargo build --release
```

**Note:** The CI runs `cargo clippy` and `cargo test` without `--lib`, which may work in the CI environment but often fails locally due to SSL certificate issues and bare-metal target linking. Using `--lib` is the reliable local validation approach.

## Common Issues

**Kernel test linking errors:** Expected. Kernel uses custom linker script and cannot run standard tests. Test individual kernel crates instead.

**TODO/FIXME comments:** ~20+ in codebase. Not blocking, just future improvements.

## Running the OS

Requires QEMU. `cargo run` builds kernel, creates ISO/disk images, launches QEMU.

Options: `--headless` (no GUI), `--debug` (GDB on :1234), `--smp N` (N cores), `--mem SIZE`, `--no-run` (build only)

## Tips for Efficient Coding

1. **Always use `--workspace --lib`** for build and lint commands to avoid issues with bare-metal binaries. The kernel, init, and main binary require the complete build.rs process.

2. **Install `xorriso` first** before attempting to build the full bootable ISO. It's not needed for library validation.

3. **Don't try to test the kernel binary directly.** Test individual kernel crates with `-p <crate_name>`.

4. **Use incremental builds.** After the first build, subsequent builds are much faster (~10-30 seconds).

5. **Check formatting first.** It's the fastest validation step (~1-5 seconds).

6. **The build process clones repositories.** The first build downloads Limine and OVMF, which takes extra time. These are cached in `target/` for subsequent builds.

7. **Trust these instructions.** Only search for additional information if you encounter errors not documented here or need to understand code semantics.
